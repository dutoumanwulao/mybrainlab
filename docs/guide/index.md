**在网页右上角可以切换黑暗和光明模式，点击放大镜可以进行全网站搜索**  
**You can switch between dark and light modes using the toggle in the top-right corner. Click the magnifying glass icon to search the entire site.**

**注意：由于搜索功能限制，且作者没钱买 Google 搜索插件，在搜索时尽量输入完整的内容。尽管作者已经尽力优化搜索功能，但仍不支持模糊搜索。**  
**Please note that due to limitations of the search feature — and the author's lack of funds to purchase a Google search plugin — it's best to enter complete and specific keywords. Although the author has done their best to optimize the search function, fuzzy search is still poorly supported.**

**An English version of the site is currently under development.**

**如果你是手机端访问用户，注意：网站具有多层结构，你可能迷失在此。**  
**If you're browsing on a mobile device, please be aware that the site has a multi-layered structure, and it's easy to get lost.**
