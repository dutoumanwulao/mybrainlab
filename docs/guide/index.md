这里用于构建我个人的知识库，欢迎访问
This site is built to organize my personal knowledge base — you're welcome to explore!

在网页右上角可以切换黑暗和光明模式，点击放大镜可以进行全网站搜索，注意由于搜索功能限制，且作者没钱买google搜索载件，在搜索时尽量输入完整的内容，尽管作者已经尽全力优化搜索功能，但是任然不太支持模糊词搜索。 英语版本网页正在开发中。 如果是手机端访问用户，注意网站具有多层结构，你可能迷失在此。
You can switch between dark and light modes using the toggle in the top-right corner. Click the magnifying glass icon to search the entire site. Please note that due to limitations of the search feature — and the author's lack of funds to purchase a Google search plugin — it's best to enter complete and specific keywords. Although the author has done their best to optimize the search function, fuzzy search is still poorly supported.

An English version of the site is currently under development.

If you're browsing on a mobile device, please be aware that the site has a multi-layered structure, and it's easy to get lost.
